# noticlip

A small program to monitor the clipboard for changes and speaks them like clip speak

## How does this work?

You first start the program and it will monitor your clipboard to see if there are any changes. If it detects changes, they get spoken. Please note that this only works with text strings as this is the main purpose of this program.

## What is the use case?

This program has been made for blind gamers who want to play games that require copying text to clipboard to be spoken automaticly.

## Why did I do this?

I did this so that I could learn the observer design pattern and it worked verry, verry well for my use case.

## How to start?

First of all, clone this repository then CD into it:

git clone https://github.com/ashleygrobler04/noticlip

cd noticlip

pip install clipboard

python clip.py

There you go!
